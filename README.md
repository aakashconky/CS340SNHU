## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
### Developing programs that can be easily maintained is a rather simple task. To ensure the maintainability of a program, it is essential to focus on its ability to incorporate additional functionalities and stay up-to-date. The key to achieving this is to design the program in a modular and reusable way. This approach allows developers to build on top of existing code without having to start from scratch each time, leading to a significant reduction in time and effort.Another crucial aspect of writing maintainable code is readability. A programmer must follow a logical sequence of instructions in their code and provide comprehensive comments that explain the purpose of each section. This enhances the readability of the code and makes it easier for other developers to understand what they are looking at. Adaptability is also a critical factor to consider while developing maintainable software. By designing modular functions that perform specific tasks, a programmer can quickly adapt their program to different input and output data types as required. This makes it much easier to modify the program to meet changing requirements without having to rewrite entire sections of code.




## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

### In my capacity as a computer scientist, my problem-solving approach typically involves assessing the desired outcome and identifying the necessary tools to achieve it. I prioritize building the most fundamental tools first before developing the code that employs these lower-level functions.Recently, I embarked on a project that differed greatly from other coursework I had undertaken before. It involved working with databases for the first time. I found the experience fascinating, particularly the process of constructing a database, building the CRUD module, and utilizing it to create an interactive page. In the past, I had primarily relied on arrays, vectors, and objects themselves to serve as storage mechanisms. However, this approach can be taxing, particularly when working with a large volume of data.Through this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, particularly in the area of building and utilizing a CRUD module. I am already considering how to adapt these techniques to the SQL database I am constructing for my own website project. I am confident that this new skillset will enable me to handle massive datasets efficiently and effectively, particularly through the use of aggregation techniques in situations where time is of the essence.



## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

### The field of computer science is dedicated to solving problems, creating software that can process data faster and more accurately than manual methods. This allows for more precise calculations and the creation of tools that can help individuals and businesses carry out their duties and enjoy a better quality of life. The importance of computer science cannot be overstated as it has revolutionized the world we live in. Without it, we would not have the many forms of entertainment we enjoy today, such as 3D graphics films and video games. Additionally, even simple tasks like calculating the number of employees for various companies would take hours instead of seconds.This project was particularly impactful, as it allowed a company to quickly and efficiently search through a database of 10,000 dog records to find the specific type of dog and age range they were looking for. Without this software, researching this information manually would have been a time-consuming task. Furthermore, the project was designed to be scalable, meaning that it could easily handle an additional 10,000 dog records without requiring any additional effort from the programmer. This means that the work done on the project can be leveraged for future use, making it a valuable investment for the company.
